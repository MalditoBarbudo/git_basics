## Introduction

`git` is a version control software, not the only one, but one of the most
widely used. But, what is *version control*?  
As the [git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) explains, version control
systems allow to record the changes a file or a set of files have been through,
allowing to revert files to a previous state, compare changes over time...  
Version control systems, and `git` in particular, are designed with
collaborative development in mind (a team working in the same codebase), but it
doesn't mean it can't be used in *solo* projects, and in fact, is recommended.

  > **Important!! `git` is not a backup system**. Is not intended to be a backup
  system. Think of it more as a time machine for your code, but you should have
  backup copies besides any version control system.
